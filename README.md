 Wikipedia article text the question 


There are three question files, one for each year of students: S08, S09, and S10, as well as 690,000 words worth of cleaned text from Wikipedia that was used to generate the questions.

The "question_answer_pairs.txt" files contain both the questions and answers. The columns in this file are as follows:

ArticleTitle is the name of the Wikipedia article from which questions and answers initially came.
Question is the question.
Answer is the answer.
